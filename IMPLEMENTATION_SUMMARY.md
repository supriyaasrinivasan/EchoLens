## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Starting Focus Mode:**
```
User clicks "Start Focus Session" 
    ↓
Dashboard sends START_FOCUS_MODE message
    ↓
Background creates declarativeNetRequest rules:
    - 60 "allow" rules for educational domains
    - 1 "block" rule for everything else
    ↓
Timer starts with live countdown
```

### 2. **URL Blocking:**
```
User tries to visit non-educational site (e.g., facebook.com)
    ↓
declarativeNetRequest intercepts request
    ↓
Checks against allow rules → No match
    ↓
Applies block rule → Redirects to focus-block.html
    ↓
Beautiful block page shows with session info
```

### 3. **Educational Sites:**
```
User visits educational site (e.g., stackoverflow.com)
    ↓
declarativeNetRequest checks rules
    ↓
Matches allow rule → Priority 2 (higher)
    ↓
Site loads normally ✅
```

### 4. **Timer Updates:**
```
Dashboard polls every 1 second
    ↓
Sends GET_FOCUS_STATUS message
    ↓
Background returns:
    - remaining time (ms)
    - progress percentage
    ↓
UI updates:
    - Timer: 24:59 → 24:58
    - Ring: fills clockwise
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### State Management:

**Dashboard Component:**
```javascript
const [focusMode, setFocusMode] = useState(false);
const [focusTimeRemaining, setFocusTimeRemaining] = useState(0);
const [focusProgress, setFocusProgress] = useState(0);

// Poll every second when active
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const status = await getFocusStatus();
    setFocusTimeRemaining(status.remaining);
    setFocusProgress(status.progress);
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [focusMode]);
```

**Background Storage:**
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.set({
  focus_mode: {
    startTime: Date.now(),
    endTime: Date.now() + duration,
    duration: duration
  }
});
```

### Message Flow:

```
Dashboard → Background
├─ START_FOCUS_MODE (duration: ms)
├─ STOP_FOCUS_MODE
├─ GET_FOCUS_STATUS
└─ Responses with status

Background → Content Scripts
├─ FOCUS_MODE_ACTIVATED
└─ FOCUS_MODE_DEACTIVATED

Background → Browser
├─ declarativeNetRequest rules
└─ Browser notifications
```
