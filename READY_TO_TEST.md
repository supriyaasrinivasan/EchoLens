**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS  
**All Critical Fixes:** ✅ APPLIED

---

## 📦 What's Been Fixed

### 1. TypeError "o is not a function" - ✅ FIXED
- **Cause:** Dynamic imports + code splitting
- **Fix:** Removed all dynamic imports, disabled code splitting
- **Result:** No more undefined function errors

### 2. CSP Violation "unsafe-eval" - ✅ FIXED  
- **Cause:** Webpack eval-based source maps
- **Fix:** Changed devtool to 'cheap-source-map'
- **Result:** No more CSP violations

### 3. Dynamic Import Blocked - ✅ FIXED
- **Cause:** Chrome extensions block import()
- **Fix:** Changed to static require() with fallback
- **Result:** KnowledgeMap component loads correctly

### 4. Missing CSP Headers - ✅ FIXED
- **Cause:** No CSP in manifest.json
- **Fix:** Added content_security_policy to manifest
- **Result:** Extension complies with Manifest V3 requirements

### 5. Large Bundle Warnings - ℹ️ EXPECTED (Not an error)
- **Cause:** React + libraries = ~395KB dashboard
- **Status:** Normal for React apps, not a bug
- **Impact:** One-time download on install

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "Extension context invalidated"
**This is NORMAL during development!**
- Happens when reloading extension
- Just close popup/dashboard and reopen
- Refresh web pages (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Popup Shows "Loading..." Forever
**Likely cause:** Background worker crashed
1. Check service worker console
2. Reload extension (🔄 button)
3. Reopen popup

### Dashboard Blank Page
**Check:**
1. Console for errors (F12)
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Service worker console

**Quick fix:**
```powershell
cd D:\EchoLens
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist
npm run build
```
Then reload extension

### No Tracking Data
**Normal if:**
- Fresh install
- Haven't visited sites for 30+ seconds

**To test:** Visit any site, wait 30 seconds, check popup "This Page"
