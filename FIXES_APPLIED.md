# 🔧 FOCUS MODE - FIXES APPLIED & TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Message Format Issue** ✅
**Problem:** Dashboard was sending `duration` directly, but background expects it in `data` object.
**Fix:** Updated `handleStartFocus` to wrap duration in `data: { duration: ... }`

### 2. **Error Handling** ✅
**Problem:** No logging or error feedback when focus mode failed.
**Fix:** Added comprehensive console logging and error handling throughout:
- Dashboard logs: "🎯 Starting focus mode with duration: X minutes"
- Background logs: "📥 Received START_FOCUS_MODE request"
- MindfulnessEngine logs: "✅ Focus mode activated successfully"

### 3. **Popup Not Working** ✅
**Problem:** Popup had no focus mode controls.
**Fix:** Added complete focus mode UI to popup with:
- "Start 25-Min Focus Mode" button
- Active focus mode indicator with timer
- Stop button when active
- Beautiful CSS animations

### 4. **Duration Validation** ✅
**Problem:** No validation of duration parameter.
**Fix:** Added null checks and validation in background handler.

### 5. **Tab Notification Errors** ✅
**Problem:** Errors when sending messages to chrome:// tabs.
**Fix:** Added URL checks to skip system tabs.

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: Using Popup (EASIEST)

```
1. Load extension in Chrome:
   - Open: chrome://extensions/
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle top-right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select: D:\SupriAI

2. Click the SupriAI extension icon in toolbar

3. You'll see a green button: "Start 25-Min Focus Mode"
   - Click it
   - Should see: "🎯 Focus mode started! 25 minutes of deep work ahead."

4. Popup will show:
   🎯 Focus Mode Active
   24:XX remaining
   [Stop] button

5. Test blocking:
   - Try to visit: facebook.com
   - Should redirect to block page ✅
   
   - Try to visit: stackoverflow.com
   - Should load normally ✅

6. Stop focus mode:
   - Click [Stop] button in popup
   - Should see: "✅ Focus session ended!"
```

### Method 2: Using Dashboard

```
1. Right-click SupriAI icon → Options
   OR click "Open Full Dashboard" in popup

2. Navigate to "Mindfulness Center" tab

3. Select duration (15, 25, 45, or 60 minutes)

4. Click "Start X-Minute Focus Session"

5. Watch the live timer:
   - Timer should count down: 25:00 → 24:59 → 24:58...
   - Progress ring should fill up
   - Should see toast: "Focus mode started..."

6. Test blocking (same as Method 1)

7. End session:
   - Click "End Session Early"
   - OR wait for timer to reach 0:00
```

## 🐛 DEBUGGING (If Still Not Working)

### Step 1: Check Console Logs

**Open Background Console:**
```
1. Go to: chrome://extensions/
2. Find SupriAI
3. Click "service worker" or "background page"
4. Console opens - watch for logs
```

**Expected logs when starting focus mode:**
```
📥 Received START_FOCUS_MODE request with data: {duration: 1500000}
🎯 Starting focus mode with duration: 1500000 ms
✅ Focus mode session saved to storage
📢 Notifying X tabs about focus mode
⏰ Setting alarm for 25 minutes
✅ Focus mode activated successfully
🎯 Focus mode blocking enabled - Only educational content allowed
✅ Focus mode blocking rules activated: 66 educational domains allowed
```

**If you see ERROR messages:**
- ❌ "No duration provided" → Check dashboard is sending data correctly
- ❌ "Error setting up declarativeNetRequest rules" → Permissions issue
- ❌ "TypeError: Cannot read..." → Engine not initialized

### Step 2: Check Dashboard Console

**Open Dashboard:**
```
Right-click on dashboard page → Inspect
```

**Expected logs when starting:**
```
🎯 Starting focus mode with duration: 25 minutes
📥 Focus mode response: {success: true, session: {...}}
```

**If you see:**
- ❌ "Failed to start focus mode" → Check response object
- ❌ "Error starting focus mode" → Check error message

### Step 3: Verify Storage

**In background console, run:**
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['focus_mode'], (result) => {
  console.log('Focus mode storage:', result);
});
```

**Expected when active:**
```javascript
{
  focus_mode: {
    startTime: 1729091234567,
    endTime: 1729092734567,
    duration: 1500000
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Check Alarms

**In background console, run:**
```javascript
chrome.alarms.getAll((alarms) => {
  console.log('Active alarms:', alarms);
});
```

**Expected when active:**
```javascript
[{
  name: "end_focus_mode",
  scheduledTime: 1729092734567,
  ...
}]
```

### Step 5: Check Blocking Rules

**In background console, run:**
```javascript
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules((rules) => {
  console.log('Active rules:', rules.length, rules);
});
```

**Expected when active:**
```
Active rules: 67 [...]
```
(60 allow rules + 1 block rule = 67 total)
