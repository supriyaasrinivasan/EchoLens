## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Enable Full Logging

**In Chrome DevTools:**
```
1. Right-click SupriAI icon
2. "Inspect" or "Manage extension"
3. Click "Inspect views" → background worker
4. Go to "Logs" tab
5. Look for messages starting with:
   - 🎯 (Focus activation)
   - 🛑 (Focus stopping)
   - ✅ (Success)
   - ❌ (Errors)
   - 📢 (Broadcasting)
```

### Check Console Output

**Expected Success Pattern:**
```
🎯 Activating focus mode...
✅ Focus overlay created
✅ Dim overlay created
✅ Focus mode activated successfully
[...timer ticking...]
🛑 Exit button clicked
🛑 Deactivating focus mode...
✅ Timer cleared
✅ Focus overlay removed
✅ Dim overlay removed
✅ Focus mode deactivated successfully
```

**Error Pattern (Requires Fix):**
```
❌ Error in focus mode message handler
📨 Content script received FOCUS_MODE_ACTIVATED: undefined
⚠️ Focus mode already active, ignoring
```

### Monitor Network Messages

**In background worker DevTools:**
```
1. Open "Network" tab
2. Filter for "focus" messages
3. Should see:
   - START_FOCUS_MODE (popup → background)
   - STOP_FOCUS_MODE (popup → background)
   - FOCUS_MODE_ACTIVATED (background → content)
   - FOCUS_MODE_DEACTIVATED (background → content)
```

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Stop button doesn't work

**Check 1: Is the button clickable?**
```
Right-click → Inspect
Check if <button> has disabled attribute
Solution: Check popup state, reload extension
```

**Check 2: Does message reach background?**
```
Open background worker logs
Search for: "STOP_FOCUS_MODE"
If not found: Content script not loaded
Solution: Reload page, try different website
```

**Check 3: Do content scripts receive message?**
```
Visit page with focus mode active
F12 → Console
Look for: "📨 Content script received FOCUS_MODE_DEACTIVATED"
If not found: Message broadcast failed
Solution: Check if tab.url is blocked (chrome:// or restricted)
```

**Check 4: Is overlay actually removed?**
```
F12 → Inspector
Search for element: #supriai-focus-overlay
If found: Overlay not removed (DOM issue)
Solution: Force refresh, clear cache, rebuild

Run in console:
document.getElementById('supriai-focus-overlay')?.remove()
document.getElementById('supriai-dim-overlay')?.remove()
document.body.classList.remove('supriai-focused')
```

### Problem: Content still hidden after stopping

**Check 1: Is dim overlay gone?**
```
F12 → Inspector
Search for: #supriai-dim-overlay
If found: Still in DOM
Solution: Manual removal (see above)
```

**Check 2: Are focus styles applied?**
```
F12 → Inspector
Check <body> classes
Search for: supriai-focused
If present: CSS class not removed
Solution: Rebuild and reload
```

**Check 3: Is pointer-events locked?**
```
In Console:
console.log(window.getComputedStyle(document.body).pointerEvents)
If not "auto": Pointer events locked
Solution: 
document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto'
```

### Problem: Timer countdown not working

**Check 1: Is timer interval created?**
```
In Console (during focus mode):
console.log(window.timerInterval)
If undefined: Interval not stored
Solution: Check activateFocusMode() code
```

**Check 2: Is timer being updated?**
```
Look at timer display
Should count down every 1 second
If stuck: Interval not running
Solution: Check for JavaScript errors in console
```

### Problem: Cannot start focus mode again

**Check 1: Is focusModeActive flag stuck?**
```
In Console:
Search background logs for: "Focus mode already active"
Solution: Page refresh, reload extension
```

**Check 2: Is previous timer still running?**
```
Kill old timer:
clearInterval(window.previousTimer)
Solution: Rebuild extension with fix
```

### Problem: Get "Failed to execute 'sendMessage'" error

**Likely cause**: Content script not loaded on this page  
**Solution**: 
```
1. Check if page is chrome://... or protected
2. Try on regular website (google.com, wikipedia.org)
3. Check manifest.json for content_scripts permissions
```

## 🚀 Next Steps After Successful Testing

1. **Database verification** (if using backend):
   ```
   - Open Dashboard
   - Go to Mindfulness view
   - Check focus sessions appear

   ```

3. **Security implementation**:
   ```
   - See CRITICAL_FIXES_REQUIRED.md
   - Add JWT authentication
   - Add input validation
   - Add rate limiting
   ```

4. **Production deployment**:
   ```
