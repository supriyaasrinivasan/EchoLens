## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Extension Not Loading?
1. Check `chrome://extensions/` for errors
2. Ensure you selected the `dist` folder, not `src`
3. Try disabling and re-enabling the extension
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Dashboard Not Opening?
1. Right-click extension icon → Options
2. Or navigate manually to extension's dashboard.html
3. Check for console errors
4. Try reloading the extension

### Graph Not Showing?
1. The graph uses react-force-graph-2d which is lazy-loaded
2. If it fails, a fallback list view appears automatically
3. Check browser console for loading errors
4. Try with a smaller dataset first

### Build Errors?
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run build
```
