## 🔧 Fixes Applied in This Session

### 1. ✅ Fixed TypeError "o is not a function"
**Problem:** Webpack code splitting + dynamic imports caused undefined function calls

**Solution:**
- Disabled code splitting: `runtimeChunk: false`, `splitChunks: false`
- Changed all dynamic `import()` to static `require()`
- File: `webpack.config.js`, `src/dashboard/components/KnowledgeMap.jsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed CSP Violation "unsafe-eval not allowed"
**Problem:** Webpack used eval-based source maps (default behavior)

**Solution:**
- Changed `devtool` from default to `'cheap-source-map'`
- Source maps now external files, not inline eval
- File: `webpack.config.js`

---

### 3. ✅ Added Content Security Policy Headers
**Problem:** Chrome Extension Manifest V3 requires explicit CSP

**Solution:**
- Added to `manifest.json`:
  ```json
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
  }
  ```
- Added CSP meta tag to dashboard.html via HtmlWebpackPlugin
- Files: `manifest.json`, `webpack.config.js`

---

### 4. ✅ Replaced Dynamic Imports with Static Imports
**Problem:** Chrome extensions block `import()` due to CSP

**Solution:**
- Changed `import('react-force-graph-2d')` to `require('react-force-graph-2d').default`
- Added try-catch with fallback component
- File: `src/dashboard/components/KnowledgeMap.jsx`

---

### 5. ✅ Created Fallback Visualization
**Problem:** react-force-graph-2d might fail in strict CSP environment

**Solution:**
- Created `KnowledgeMapFallback.jsx` with pure CSS grid visualization
- Cluster-based view grouping memories by tags
- Color-coded by recency (purple=recent, blue=week, cyan=month, gray=old)
- File: `src/dashboard/components/KnowledgeMapFallback.jsx`

---

### 6. ✅ Optimized Build Configuration
**Problem:** Large bundles, no minification

**Solution:**
- Added TerserPlugin with safe compression settings
- Set `mode: 'production'`
- Configured safe minification (no unsafe transforms)
- File: `webpack.config.js`, `package.json` (added terser-webpack-plugin)

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Warnings

### Build Warnings (NOT ERRORS - These are OK):
```
WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
Assets: dashboard.js (395 KiB)
```

**Status:** ✅ Expected and acceptable
- React + ReactDOM + react-force-graph-2d = large bundle
- This is normal for React extensions
- Only affects initial load time (one-time per install)

---

## 🚀 How to Load & Test

### Step 1: Load Extension
```powershell
# Already built, but if you need to rebuild:
cd D:\EchoLens
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Install in Chrome
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `D:\EchoLens\dist` folder
5. Extension should appear with green "Enabled" status

### Step 3: Test Components

**Background Service Worker:**
- On `chrome://extensions/`, find EchoLens
- Click "Inspect views" → "service worker"
- Check console for initialization message

**Popup:**
- Click EchoLens icon in toolbar
- Right-click popup → Inspect → check Console
- Verify no errors

**Dashboard:**
- Right-click icon → Options
- Press F12 → check Console
- Try switching views (1-4 keys)
- Test Knowledge Map (should show graph or fallback)

**Content Script:**
- Visit any website
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Check console for any EchoLens errors

---

## 📊 File Integrity Check

Run this to verify all files exist:

```powershell
# Check dist folder
Get-ChildItem D:\EchoLens\dist -Recurse | Select-Object Name, Length

# Should show:
# manifest.json (990 bytes)
# dashboard.js (395+ KB)
# popup.js (169+ KB)
# background.js (24+ KB)
# content.js (9+ KB)
# All .html, .css, .map files
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### First Install:
1. Extension loads without errors
2. Popup shows "No memories yet"
3. Dashboard shows empty views with 0 stats
4. Service worker console shows initialization message

### After Browsing:
1. Visit websites for 30+ seconds
2. Popup shows stats and visit history
3. Dashboard populates with memories
4. Knowledge Map shows connections (or fallback grid)

### Features Working:
- ✅ Visit tracking and time measurement
- ✅ Memory storage in chrome.storage.local
- ✅ Stats calculation (total visits, time, highlights)
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Export/Import data (JSON)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Multiple view modes
- ⚠️ AI features (requires API key configuration)
- ⚠️ Highlighting (if implemented in content script)

---

## 🆘 Emergency Troubleshooting

### If Extension Won't Load:
```powershell
cd D:\EchoLens
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist
npm run build
# Then reload on chrome://extensions/
```

### If Service Worker Crashes:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click reload icon (🔄) on EchoLens card
3. Click "Inspect views" → "service worker" to restart

### If Popup/Dashboard Shows Blank:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console for React errors
3. Check Network tab for failed loads
4. Verify `root` div exists in HTML

### If "Extension context invalidated":
**This is normal during development!**
- Happens when you reload the extension
- Just close and reopen popup/dashboard
- Refresh any open webpages

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before reporting more bugs, verify:

- [ ] Extension loaded on `chrome://extensions/` without errors
- [ ] Service worker console checked (no errors at startup)
- [ ] Popup opens and shows content (or "no memories")

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

**Background Service Worker** (`background.js`)
- Runs persistently in background
- Handles storage, message passing, AI processing
- Check console at: chrome://extensions/ → Inspect views → service worker

**Content Script** (`content.js`)
- Injected into every webpage
- Tracks time, scrolling, interactions
- Sends data to background script

**Popup** (`popup.js`)
- Click extension icon to open
- Shows quick stats and recent memories
- Communicates with background via chrome.runtime.sendMessage

**Dashboard** (`dashboard.js`)
- Full-page view of all memories
- 4 visualization modes
- Opens via right-click icon → Options

## 🔑 Key Changes from Original Code

1. **Webpack Config:**
   - ❌ Before: Default devtool (eval-based source maps)
   - ✅ After: 'cheap-source-map' (external source maps)
   
   - ❌ Before: Code splitting enabled (default)
   - ✅ After: Disabled (causes issues in extensions)

2. **KnowledgeMap Component:**
   - ❌ Before: `import('react-force-graph-2d').then(...)`
   - ✅ After: `require('react-force-graph-2d').default` with try-catch

3. **Manifest:**
   - ❌ Before: No CSP headers
   - ✅ After: `content_security_policy.extension_pages` added

4. **Build Process:**
   - ❌ Before: No minification
   - ✅ After: TerserPlugin with safe compression

---

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Load the extension** (follow "How to Load & Test" above)
2. **Test each component** systematically (use TESTING_GUIDE.md)
3. **Document specific failures** with:
   - Component name
   - Console errors (exact text)
   - Screenshots
   - Steps to reproduce

4. **Report back** with specific details so I can fix targeted issues

---

**Current Status:** ✅ Built successfully, ready for testing
**Action Required:** Load in Chrome and report specific errors encountered

All previous CSP and TypeError issues should now be resolved. If you encounter other bugs, they will likely be component-specific logic errors that need targeted fixes based on the exact error messages.
