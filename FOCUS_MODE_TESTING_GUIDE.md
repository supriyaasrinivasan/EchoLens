# 🎯 Complete Focus Mode Testing Guide

## What's Been Implemented

I've built a **complete focus mode system** that:
1. ✅ Shows a **live countdown timer** in the dashboard (updates every second)
2. ✅ **Blocks all non-educational websites** automatically during focus sessions
3. ✅ **Allows only educational sites** (60+ domains whitelisted)
4. ✅ Uses Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API for efficient blocking
5. ✅ Shows a **beautiful block page** when non-educational sites are accessed
6. ✅ Tracks session progress with a **circular progress ring**
7. ✅ Saves session data with completion status

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Test

### 1. Load the Extension
```powershell
# The extension is already built in: d:\SupriAI\dist

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select: D:\SupriAI (or D:\SupriAI\dist)
6. Extension loads ✅
```

### 2. Start a Focus Session
```
1. Click SupriAI extension icon in toolbar
2. Click "Open Dashboard" (or right-click > Options)
3. Click "Mindfulness Center" tab
4. Select duration: 25 minutes (recommended)
5. Click "Start 25-Minute Focus Session"
```

**What You'll See:**
- 🎯 Toast: "Focus mode started! 25 minutes of deep work ahead 🎯"
- ⏱️ Live timer appears: "25:00" counting down
- 📊 Circular progress ring starts filling
- 🔥 Info cards: "Only educational content is accessible"

### 3. Test Blocking (Try These URLs)

**❌ Should Be BLOCKED (Non-Educational):**
```
https://facebook.com
https://twitter.com
https://reddit.com
https://instagram.com
https://tiktok.com
https://netflix.com
```

**Expected:** Browser redirects to beautiful block page showing:
- 🎯 "Focus Mode is Active"
- ⏱️ Countdown timer
- 📊 Progress percentage
- 📈 Sites blocked counter
- 💡 List of allowed educational sites

**✅ Should Be ALLOWED (Educational):**
```
https://stackoverflow.com
https://github.com
https://wikipedia.org
https://developer.mozilla.org
https://w3schools.com
https://coursera.org
https://khanacademy.org
```

**Expected:** Sites load normally, no blocking.

## 📊 What Happens in the Dashboard

### During Active Focus Session:

**Timer Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    🎯 Focus Mode        │
│   is Active! 🎯        │
│                         │
│      ╭───────╮          │
│      │ 24:35 │  ← Live countdown
│      │remaining│         │
│      ╰───────╯          │
│   [Progress Ring]       │
│                         │
│ 🔥 Only educational     │
│    content accessible   │
│                         │
│ 🚫 Non-educational      │
│    sites are blocked    │
│                         │
│ [End Session Early]     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Progress Ring:**
- Starts empty (0%)
- Fills clockwise as time passes
- Reaches 100% at completion

### After Session Ends:

**Recent Sessions List:**
```
Recent Sessions
├─ ✓ Completed: 25m | Today at 2:30 PM
├─ ✓ Completed: 45m | Today at 12:00 PM
└─ Interrupted: 15m | Yesterday at 5:00 PM
```

**Statistics Updated:**
```
Focus Time: 2h 15m  (increased)
Completion Rate: 85%  (calculated)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Blocking Works:

1. **When you start focus mode:**
   ```javascript
   // Background creates 60+ allow rules
   Allow: *.edu, *.stackoverflow.com, *.github.com, etc.
   
   // Plus one catch-all block rule
   Block: * (everything else)
   
   // Redirect blocked sites to:
   chrome-extension://.../focus-block.html
   ```

2. **Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API:**
   - Runs in browser engine (super fast)
   - No performance impact
   - Intercepts before page loads
   - More efficient than webRequest

3. **Fallback system:**
   - If declarativeNetRequest fails
   - Uses webNavigation API
   - Same blocking, different method

### Educational Domains (60+):

**Categories:**
- 🎓 Universities: .edu, .ac.uk, .ac.in
- 📚 Learning: Coursera, Udemy, Khan Academy, edX
- 📖 Docs: MDN, W3Schools, official framework docs
- 🔬 Research: Wikipedia, arXiv, Google Scholar
- 💻 Dev: Stack Overflow, GitHub, Dev.to
- 📝 Tutorials: freeCodeCamp, LeetCode, HackerRank

### Timer Update Flow:

```javascript
// Dashboard polls every 1 second
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    // Ask background for status
    const status = await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
      type: 'GET_FOCUS_STATUS'
    });
    
    // Update timer: 24:59, 24:58, 24:57...
    setFocusTimeRemaining(status.remaining);
    
    // Update progress: 1%, 2%, 3%...
    setFocusProgress(status.progress);
  }, 1000);
}, [focusMode]);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Timer Not Starting

**Symptoms:** Click start, nothing happens

**Debug Steps:**
```javascript
1. Open dashboard console (F12)
2. Look for: "Focus mode started!" message
3. Check for errors (red text)
4. Open background console:
   - Go to: chrome://extensions
   - Find SupriAI
   - Click "background page" or "service worker"
   - Look for: "🎯 Focus mode blocking enabled"
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Reload extension: chrome://extensions > reload icon
- Clear storage: Background console > Application > Clear storage
- Rebuild: `npm run build` in PowerShell

### Issue: Sites Not Blocking

**Symptoms:** Can access Facebook during focus mode

**Debug Steps:**
```javascript
1. Background console (chrome://extensions)
2. Run: chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules()
3. Should show ~61 rules (60 allow + 1 block)
4. Check permissions in manifest.json:
   - "declarativeNetRequest" ✅
   - "host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"] ✅
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Check manifest.json has permissions (already included)
- Reload extension completely
- Restart Chrome browser
- Check focus mode is actually active (timer showing?)

### Issue: Block Page Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Sites just don't load, no block page

**Debug Steps:**
```javascript
1. Check file exists: dist/focus-block.html
2. Check manifest web_accessible_resources:
   - "focus-block.html" ✅
3. Try direct URL:
   chrome-extension://[YOUR-EXTENSION-ID]/focus-block.html
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
- Check webpack.config.js copies file (already configured)
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Timer Not Updating

**Symptoms:** Timer shows 25:00 and never changes

**Debug Steps:**
```javascript
1. Dashboard console (F12)
2. Look for errors in polling interval
3. Check: chrome.storage.local.get(['focus_mode'])
4. Should show: { endTime: [timestamp], duration: 1500000 }
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Check chrome.storage permission (already in manifest)
- Verify GET_FOCUS_STATUS handler in background.js (already implemented)
- Reload dashboard tab
