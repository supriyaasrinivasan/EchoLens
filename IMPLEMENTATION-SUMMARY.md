# 🎉 EchoLens Extension - Fixed and Enhanced!

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### Primary Issue Fixed: TypeError: o is not a function
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

**What was causing it:**
- The `react-force-graph-2d` library was being imported synchronously
- In some build configurations or runtime environments, this could fail
- No error handling existed, causing the entire dashboard to crash

**How it was fixed:**
1. **Lazy Loading**: Changed to dynamic import using `import()` syntax
2. **Error Boundaries**: Added React ErrorBoundary component to catch errors
3. **Fallback UI**: When graph fails to load, shows alternative list view
4. **Loading States**: Added proper loading indicators
5. **Safe Rendering**: Component only renders after library loads successfully
