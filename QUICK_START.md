#### Configure AI Features

1. Click the SupriAI icon in your toolbar

**Note:** The extension works WITHOUT an API key using fallback analysis, but AI-powered insights are much better!

### Step 3: Start Browsing

Just browse normally! SupriAI works in the background:

- **Captures** page content and metadata
