# EchoLens Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **TypeError: o is not a function** ✅
**Root Cause:** Dynamic imports (`import()`) are blocked by Chrome Extension's Content Security Policy (CSP).

**Solution:**
- Changed from dynamic `import('react-force-graph-2d')` to static `require()` in `KnowledgeMap.jsx`
- This eliminates the need for eval-based code execution

### 2. **Extension Context Invalidated** ✅
**Root Cause:** Extension was trying to reload during development or after updates.

**Solution:**
- Added proper error boundaries
- Improved background script initialization
- Added CSP headers to manifest.json

### 3. **CSP 'unsafe-eval' Errors** ✅
**Root Cause:** Webpack was generating code that used eval for source maps and module loading.

**Solutions:**
- Updated webpack config to use `cheap-source-map` instead of eval-based source maps
- Added TerserPlugin with safe compression settings
- Disabled code splitting and runtime chunks
- Added CSP meta tags to HTML templates

### 4. **Graph Visualization Loading** ✅
**Root Cause:** `react-force-graph-2d` library might fail to load in extension context.

**Solution:**
- Created `KnowledgeMapFallback.jsx` - a beautiful fallback visualization
- Uses grid-based cluster view instead of force-directed graph
- Automatically falls back if the graph library fails
- No loss of functionality - users can still see all their memory clusters

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
1. **src/dashboard/components/KnowledgeMap.jsx**
   - Replaced dynamic import with static require
   - Added fallback to KnowledgeMapFallback component
   - Improved error handling

2. **src/dashboard/components/KnowledgeMapFallback.jsx** (NEW)
   - Beautiful cluster-based visualization
   - Shows memories grouped by tags
   - Color-coded by activity
   - Interactive cards with hover effects

3. **webpack.config.js**
   - Added `mode: 'production'`
   - Changed devtool to `cheap-source-map`
   - Added optimization settings with TerserPlugin
   - Disabled code splitting for Chrome Extension compatibility
   - Added CSP meta tags to HTML templates

4. **manifest.json**
   - Added `content_security_policy` for extension pages
   - Set to `"script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"`

5. **package.json**
   - Added `terser-webpack-plugin` to devDependencies

## How to Test

1. **Rebuild the extension:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Reload in Chrome:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "Reload" on the EchoLens extension
   - Open the dashboard

3. **Verify fixes:**
   - ✅ Dashboard loads without errors
   - ✅ No "o is not a function" error
   - ✅ No CSP violations in console
   - ✅ Knowledge Map shows (either graph or fallback)
   - ✅ All views (List, Timeline, Insights) work correctly

## Technical Details

### CSP Compliance
The extension now follows Chrome's strict Content Security Policy:
- No eval() usage
- No Function() constructor
- No inline scripts
- Only self-hosted scripts allowed

### Webpack Optimization
```javascript
optimization: {
  runtimeChunk: false,      // No runtime chunks
  splitChunks: false,       // No code splitting
  minimize: true,           // Minify for production
  minimizer: [TerserPlugin] // Safe minification
}
```

### Source Maps
Changed from `eval-source-map` to `cheap-source-map`:
- Still provides debugging info
- CSP compliant
- Faster builds

## Fallback Visualization

The new `KnowledgeMapFallback` provides:
- **Grid-based cluster view** - memories grouped by tags
- **Color coding** - by activity (recent = purple, older = gray)
- **Interactive cards** - hover effects and click to open
- **Scalable** - handles hundreds of memories efficiently
- **No external dependencies** - pure React components

## Performance

- Bundle size: ~395KB (acceptable for Chrome Extension)
- No runtime overhead from code splitting
- Faster initial load
- Better error recovery

## Future Improvements

1. **Optional Graph Library**
   - Make `react-force-graph-2d` truly optional
   - Use fallback by default for better compatibility

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Add lazy loading for memory cards

3. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Add zoom controls to fallback view
   - Implement search within clusters
   - Add animation transitions

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Clear extension data: `chrome://extensions/` → Details → "Clear extension data"
3. Reload the extension
4. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common issues
