# Focus Mode Fix Guide - Stop Button & Content Display

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXES APPLIED  
**Issue**: Timer stop functionality not working + content not displaying on EchoLenz pages

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Stop Button Not Working
**Problem**: Click on stop button in popup or focus mode banner was not properly deactivating focus mode
**Root Causes**:
- Timer interval not properly referenced/cleared
- Message communication between popup and content script incomplete
- Multiple timers potentially running simultaneously

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `this.timerInterval` instance variable to track active timer
- Clear and cleanup timer properly in both exit button handler and deactivation
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Broadcast deactivation message to all tabs from background worker

### Issue 2: Content Not Visible After Focus Mode Ends
**Problem**: Overlay and dim layer remained visible after stopping, blocking page content
**Root Causes**:
- Overlays not being completely removed from DOM
- CSS styles not being properly reverted
- Pointer events still disabled on body element

**Solution Applied**:
- Add fade-out animations before removing overlays
- Reset body styles explicitly
- Force pointer events back to auto
- Add more thorough cleanup checks

### Issue 3: Focus Status Sync Between Popup and Content
**Problem**: Popup wasn't aware focus mode was stopped until manually refreshed
**Root Causes**:
- No callback to popup when focus mode stops
- Focus status not re-checked after stop action

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `checkFocusMode()` call in stopFocusMode handler
- Better error messages and alerts with specific feedback
- Ensure popup UI updates immediately after stop

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Content Script (content.js) - 3 Critical Updates

**Update 1.1 - Added timer interval tracking:**
```javascript
// NEW: Store timer interval reference
this.timerInterval = null;
```

**Update 1.2 - Enhanced setupFocusModeListener:**
```javascript
setupFocusModeListener() {
  chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
    try {
      // Added: Comprehensive logging
      // Added: Error handling with sendResponse
      // Result: Better error tracking and communication
    } catch (error) {
      sendResponse({ success: false, error: error.message });
    }
    return true;
  });
}
```

**Update 1.3 - Improved activateFocusMode:**
```javascript
activateFocusMode(duration) {
  // ADDED: Check and clear existing timer to prevent duplicates
  if (this.timerInterval) {
    clearInterval(this.timerInterval);
  }
  
  // CHANGED: Store interval reference
  this.timerInterval = setInterval(() => { ... }, 1000);
  
  // ADDED: Handle focus session completion
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'FOCUS_SESSION_COMPLETED' });
  
  // CHANGED: Exit button now properly clears timer
  exitBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (this.timerInterval) {
      clearInterval(this.timerInterval);
      this.timerInterval = null;
    }
  });
}
```

**Update 1.4 - Completely rewrote deactivateFocusMode:**
```javascript
deactivateFocusMode() {
  // ADDED: Enhanced logging at each step
  // ADDED: Clear timer if running
  if (this.timerInterval) {
    clearInterval(this.timerInterval);
    this.timerInterval = null;
  }
  
  // CHANGED: Fade out overlay before removing
  focusOverlay.style.display = 'none';
  setTimeout(() => { focusOverlay.remove(); }, 100);
  
  dimOverlay.style.opacity = '0';
  dimOverlay.style.transition = 'opacity 0.3s ease-out';
  setTimeout(() => { dimOverlay.remove(); }, 300);
  
  // ADDED: Explicitly reset body styles
  document.body.classList.remove('supriai-focused');
  document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
}
```

### 2. Popup (Popup.jsx) - Enhanced Error Handling

**Updated stopFocusMode:**
```javascript
const stopFocusMode = async () => {
  // ADDED: Comprehensive logging
  console.log('🛑 Stopping focus mode...');
  
  // ADDED: Better error feedback
  if (response && response.success) {
    setFocusMode(false);
    await checkFocusMode(); // ADDED: Re-check status
    alert('✅ Focus session ended! Check the content page - it should be back to normal.');
  } else {
    const errorMsg = response?.error || 'Unknown error';
    alert('⚠️ Failed to stop focus mode: ' + errorMsg);
    console.error('Focus mode stop failed:', response);
  }
}
```

**New Features**:
- ✅ Calls `checkFocusMode()` after stopping
- ✅ Specific error messages
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ User-friendly alerts with instructions

### 3. Background Worker (background.js) - Message Broadcasting

**Updated STOP_FOCUS_MODE handler:**
```javascript
case 'STOP_FOCUS_MODE':
  try {
    await this.mindfulness.deactivateFocusMode();
    await this.disableFocusModeBlocking();
    
    // ADDED: Broadcast deactivation to all tabs
    const tabs = await chrome.tabs.query({});
    tabs.forEach(tab => {
      chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {
        type: 'FOCUS_MODE_DEACTIVATED'
      }).catch((err) => {
        // Ignore errors for tabs without content script
      });
    });
    
    sendResponse({ success: true, message: 'Focus mode deactivated' });
  } catch (error) {
    sendResponse({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
  break;
```

**New Features**:
- ✅ Queries all active tabs
- ✅ Sends deactivation message to each tab
- ✅ Graceful error handling for tabs without content script
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. Mindfulness Engine (mindfulness-engine.js) - Improved Tab Notification

**Updated deactivateFocusMode:**
```javascript
async deactivateFocusMode() {
  // ADDED: Step-by-step logging
  console.log('🛑 Mindfulness engine deactivating focus mode...');
  
  // ADDED: Better error handling
  const promises = tabs.map(tab => {
    return chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {
      type: 'FOCUS_MODE_DEACTIVATED'
    }).catch(err => {
      console.log(`ℹ️ Tab ${tab.id} could not receive message`);
    });
  });
  
  await Promise.all(promises);
  console.log('✅ All available tabs notified');
}
```

**New Features**:
- ✅ Promise-based tab notification
- ✅ Better error logging
- ✅ Graceful degradation for inaccessible tabs
- ✅ Confirmation of all notifications sent

### 5. Content Styles (content.css) - Fixed Content Display

**Updated styles:**
```css
/* ADDED: Explicit reset when focus mode is off */
body:not(.supriai-focused) main,
body:not(.supriai-focused) article,
body:not(.supriai-focused) [role="main"] {
  background: inherit;
  padding: inherit;
  border-radius: inherit;
  box-shadow: inherit;
  z-index: auto;
}

/* ADDED: Force body to be interactive */
body {
  pointer-events: auto !important;
}
```

**New Features**:
- ✅ Explicit reset of all focus mode styles
- ✅ Force enable pointer events on body
- ✅ Inheritance of normal styles when focus mode ends
- ✅ Smooth visual transition

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Enable Chrome Extension Debugging
```
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right)
3. Click "Inspect views" under SupriAI
4. Open DevTools for background worker
5. Go to "Logs" tab to see console output
```

### Check Content Script Logs
```
1. Visit any website (e.g., Google)
2. Right-click → "Inspect"
3. Go to Console tab
4. Start/stop focus mode
5. Look for messages like:
   - "🎯 Activating focus mode with duration: 1500000 ms"
   - "🛑 Exit button clicked"
   - "✅ Focus mode deactivated successfully"
```

### Monitor Message Flow
**Expected message sequence when stopping:**
```
Popup:
  📥 STOP_FOCUS_MODE received
  🛑 Stopping focus mode...
  ✅ Response received: { success: true }

Background:
  📥 Received STOP_FOCUS_MODE request
  🛑 Mindfulness engine deactivating...
  📢 Broadcasting to N tabs
  ✅ All tabs notified

Content Script:
  📨 Received FOCUS_MODE_DEACTIVATED
  🛑 Deactivating focus mode...
  ✅ Focus mode deactivated successfully
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Stop button does nothing**
- Solution 1: Check background worker logs for errors
- Solution 2: Ensure content script is loaded (check "Inspect views")
- Solution 3: Try on a different website (some sites block content scripts)

**Issue: Content still dimmed after stopping**
- Solution 1: Check if dim overlay element exists: `document.getElementById('supriai-dim-overlay')`
- Solution 2: Check if focus class is still on body: `document.body.classList.contains('supriai-focused')`
- Solution 3: Try page refresh or switch tabs

**Issue: Timer doesn't countdown**
- Solution 1: Check if timer interval is being created
- Solution 2: Verify `this.timerInterval` is not null
- Solution 3: Check for JavaScript errors in console

**Issue: "Refresh failed" message**
- Solution 1: Make sure extension has permission to access the tab
- Solution 2: Try a public website instead of protected sites
- Solution 3: Check if tab URL starts with "chrome://" (these are blocked)
