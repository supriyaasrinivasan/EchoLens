### 1. **Which component is broken?**
- [ ] Extension won't load at all
- [ ] Background service worker errors
- [ ] Popup won't open/shows errors
- [ ] Dashboard won't load
- [ ] Knowledge Map component
- [ ] Other specific component: __________

### 2. **Exact error messages**
Copy from Chrome DevTools Console:
```

## üîß Quick Self-Diagnostics

### Issue: Extension won't load
**Check:**
- Is `dist/` folder generated? (should contain manifest.json, *.js files)
- Is manifest.json valid? Check for syntax errors

**Fix:** Run `npm run build` again

---

### Issue: "Extension context invalidated"
**This is normal during development!**

**Fix:** 
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the reload icon (üîÑ) on EchoLens
3. Close and reopen popup/dashboard

---

### Issue: Dashboard shows blank page
**Check console for:**
- React errors
- Module loading errors
- CSP violations

**Quick test:**
1. Open `D:\EchoLens\dist\dashboard.html` directly in browser
2. Check if it loads (will have different behavior but shows if React works)

---

### Issue: Popup shows "Loading..." forever
**Likely causes:**
- Background service worker not running
- Message passing broken

**Fix:**
1. Check service worker console for errors
2. Reload extension
3. Check Chrome storage permissions in manifest.json

---

## üìä Current Status (After Latest Fixes)

### ‚úÖ FIXED:
- TypeError "o is not a function" (removed dynamic imports)

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Always check BOTH consoles:** Popup/Dashboard console AND service worker console
- **Reload extension** after each code change (click üîÑ on chrome://extensions/)
- **Hard refresh pages** after reloading extension (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Check Network tab** in DevTools if seeing loading issues
- **Disable other extensions** temporarily to rule out conflicts

---

## üÜò Emergency Reset

If everything is broken:

```powershell
# Clean rebuild
cd D:\EchoLens
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist
npm run build
```

Then reload extension on `chrome://extensions/`
