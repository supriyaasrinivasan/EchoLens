**Your AI Mirror — Track how your digital identity evolves**

SupriAI is a Chrome extension that combines memory tracking with personality insights, transforming your browsing into a journey of self-awareness.

---

## 🌟 What is SupriAI?

SupriAI evolved from EchoLens to become more than just a memory tool — it's now your **digital self-awareness engine**. We leave fragments of our personality everywhere online through our searches, likes, and curiosities. SupriAI tracks how your digital identity evolves — your interests, tone, learning curve, and emotional energy — and turns it into a living profile that grows with you.

Think of it as an **AI mirror** for your browsing habits.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🪞 1. Personality Reflection Engine

Each week, SupriAI generates an **"identity snapshot"** — summarizing your tone, favorite topics, reading habits, and emotional themes.

**Example output:**
> "This week, your reading leaned toward AI ethics, self-growth, and nostalgic design.  
> Your tone: analytical, reflective, mildly optimistic."

### 🔄 2. Interest Evolution Timeline

Visual timeline showing how your passions have shifted over time — from "machine learning" → "AI storytelling" → "ethical design."

Each bubble pulses like a heartbeat, marking your intellectual growth.

### 📈 3. MindSync Dashboard

Your central hub:
- **Trending interests** — What's capturing your attention
- **Weekly mood summary** — From text tone + sites visited
- **Quote of the Week** — Generated by AI to match your vibe
- **Goal alignment** — Track your progress toward monthly goals

### 🎯 4. Goal Alignment AI

Whenever you browse, SupriAI checks:
> "Is this aligned with your 3 main goals for the month?"

**Example:**
- You said you wanted to learn React.
- It gently nudges you: _"You've spent 2 hours on memes today. Back to React?"_ 😅

Not judgmental — just your wise, digital mentor.

### 🌈 5. The Digital Twin

Over time, SupriAI builds a **digital twin of your curiosity** — an AI reflection trained on your browsing patterns and tone.

Eventually, you can ask it things like:
- "What would I have thought about NFTs last year?"
- "What topics have I been avoiding lately?"
- "How has my interest in AI evolved?"

3. **Builds Your Profile** — Learns your patterns and interests
4. **Generates Insights** — Weekly snapshots, mood tracking, and evolution timeline
